# # Joy Ride - Part 1: Drag Race
# 
# The goal here is to get you familiar with how to control the simulated car with code. To get started:
# 
# 1. Run the cell below this one by pressing `Ctrl + Enter`
# 2. Click the button that says "Launch Car Simulator". A new tab should open in your browser.
# 3. Arrange your tabs as shown below so that this notebook is on one side of the screen and the simulator is on the other. ![code next to simulator](https://i.imgur.com/zhPjERi.jpg)
# 4. Run the cell (`Ctrl + Enter`) marked "CODE CELL". The car in the simulator should start moving. You should notice a problem...
# 5. Press the **Reset** button in the simulator and then modify the code in the code cell. You should only need to change one line of code...
# 6. When you think you've fixed the problem, run the code cell again. Did the car make it over the trees?

get_ipython().run_cell_magic('HTML', '', '<button id="launcher">Launch Car Simulator</button>\n<script src="setupLauncher.js"></script>\n\n# NOTE - depending on your computer it may take a few minutes for the \n#   simulator to load after you press the button! This time might \n#   be reduced if you use Google Chrome and close as many other tabs \n#   as possible')

# This is the code you should 
# edit and run to control the car.

def jump(car):
    # TODO - make modifications in this function
    #   so that your car makes it safely over the trees.
    
    car.steer(0.0) # any value between -25 and 25 works here for
                   # steering angle (in degrees)
        
    car.gas(0.0)   # any value between -1.0 (full reverse) and 
                   # 1.0 (full throttle) works here
